## About
This project was a one Week of intense learning as we were exposed to a lot of advance concepts.

## Objectives
Create a application to connect "Teachers" and "Students" focusing on a Mobile First layout, then apply responsive properties, so elements of the page can properly adjust to bigger screens providing a nice experience to the user. 

We used SQLITE db, created a squema for our application, learned how to perform basic SQL queries to CREATE TABLES, INSERT VALUES AND CONSULT/FILTER VALUES. 

In addition, we used GRID areas to properly position elements within the page and we learned how to use setTimeout to show a page for 2 seconds, then redirect to another page.
